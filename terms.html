<p><b>Fees</b></p>
<p>
The second-hand uniform sales are run on behalf of parents and PA. After the sale of your items you
receive approximately 75% and 25% goes to the PA.
</p>

<p><b>Condition of uniform</b></p>
<p>All second hand uniform must be washed, folded and in good condition. If
deemed not to be we will recycle the item without notification. Only current uniform will be re-sold
e.g. not old logo blazers or duffle coats.</p>

<p><b>Items for collection</b></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>All items must be clearly and securely labelled with the new sale labels to enable quick sorting
and sale of your items. Ideally this is to be safety pinned to a prominent location – if labels
fall off proceeds will go to the PA.</li>
<li>Items must be accompanied with a completed uniform form so we know what items we have
and who is to be paid on sale of the items. Please place items in a plastic bag and tie securely.</li>
<li>If you want to donate items to the PA and not receive any money from the sale please place
items in a bag with a note clearly stating donation and tie securely.</li>
<li>With agreement of the team/ Mrs Ranger under certain circumstances items can be left in the
school office.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Sales</b></p>
<p>This is the best time to come and get items you will need for the coming months. It is when we
have the most stock as collections have just been made.</p>

<p><b>Online</b></p>
<p>We will shortly be offering the ability to view and order items online.</p>

<p><b>Buying Items outside of the Sales</b></p>
<p>In some circumstances we will be able to help you get an item
outside of the sales. The stock is kept boxed in a very full shed so it is not easy to locate items between
sales so we can’t guarantee to be able to help but please do check with us.</p>

<p><b>Payment</b></p>
<p>Will be processed after a sale and will be made directly into your bank account, details of
which need to be on the submission form, or via cheque.</p>

<p><b>Old stock</b></p>
<p>Any items which have not been sold after a reasonable time (at least 1 year) will be reduced
in sale price and profit donated to PA, unless you requested on your submission form to take the item
back.</p>
